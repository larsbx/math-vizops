"""What a render run reports. Three inhabitants, and the third has a name.

A render either produced a file, was refused, or reached no verdict at all.
The third case is not a failure and not a pass: a machine with no OpenGL
context, or no `manimgl` on its PATH, has not shown that a scene is broken and
has not shown that it works. Coercing it to either would be a verdict the run
did not reach, so it carries its own name and its own exit code.

The set is closed. A fourth outcome would have to be declared here, beside the
exit codes, rather than invented at a call site -- so subclassing from outside
this module is refused rather than merely discouraged.
