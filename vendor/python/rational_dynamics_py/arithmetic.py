"""Arithmetic functions the doubling-map number theory reads: Moebius, Dedekind
sums and Ramanujan sums, exactly.

Ported from larsbx/finite-mandelbrot-research
reference/python/c1/misiurewicz_catalogue_reference.py (``moebius``) and
larsbx/mandelbrot-bulbs-and-ford-circles-research experiments/scripts/bridges_spike.py
(``dedekind``, the reciprocity algorithm) and experiments/scripts/spectral.py
(``ramanujan``, which summed cosines in floating point; here it is the exact
divisor sum). The truncated Brjuno sum of spectral.py stays in that
repository: it is a sum of logarithms, not an exact quantity.

What is claimed: each value is the exact integer or rational of its
definition. What is not: any spectral or asymptotic statement a consumer
builds on them.
