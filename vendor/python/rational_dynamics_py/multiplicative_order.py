"""The multiplicative order of two modulo an odd ``m``: ``ord_m(2)``, exactly and uncapped.

C. F. Gauss, *Disquisitiones Arithmeticae* (1801), articles 45-52; standard
reference: Ireland and Rosen, *A Classical Introduction to Modern Number
Theory*, 2nd ed. (1990), chapter 4. The order is found by direct powering for
small orders and otherwise from the Carmichael function (``carmichael``) by
trial-division factorisation; either way it is exact, and the cost of a huge
``m`` with a huge order is time, never a wrong answer. Independent reference
of the Mojo ``rational_dynamics.multiplicative_order``.
